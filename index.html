<h1>Welcome to the Tinkerhub SOE Basic Website Building Challenge!</h1>

<p>Are you ready to showcase your creativity, coding skills, and design flair? We're excited to introduce you to the Basic Website Building Challenge, an opportunity for all first-year students at SOE to create and host their very own static website. Whether you're a coding enthusiast or just dipping your toes into the world of web development, this challenge is for you. Trust me, this could not be more beginner-friendly.</p>

<h2>What's the Challenge About?</h2>

<p>The challenge is all about building a static website using HTML (Just like this one). Don't worry if you're new to these technologies â€“ we've got you covered with some fantastic resources to help you get started.</p>

<h3>Challenge Guidelines:</h3>

<p><strong>Website Theme:</strong> You have the freedom to choose the theme of your website. It could be a personal website, a tribute to your favorite philosopher, a technology showcase, or even a celebration of a cultural event like Onam.</p>

<p><strong>Content:</strong> Your website should have a minimum of one HTML page. Feel free to explore various HTML tags to structure your content. You can add text, images, links, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Styling:</strong> While not necessary, if HTML alone comes easy to you, you can use CSS to style your website and make it visually appealing. You can experiment with colors, fonts, layouts, and more. We've provided references to CSS libraries like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a> to help you out.</p>

<p><strong>Hosting:</strong> Your website must be hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. It's a simple process, and we'll guide you through it.</p>

<h3>How to Host on GitHub Pages:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Create a GitHub Account: If you don't have one already, <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">create an account on GitHub</a>.</li>
    <li>Create a Repository: Inside your GitHub account, create a new repository. Name it something like "my-website."</li>
    <li>Upload Your Code: Upload your HTML and CSS files to your repository. You can do this directly on the GitHub website or by using Git commands.</li>
    <li>Enable GitHub Pages: In your repository settings, navigate to the "Pages" section. Choose the main branch and save your settings.</li>
    <li>Access Your Website: Your website will now be accessible at a link like - https://yourusername.github.io/my-website</li>
</ol>

<h3>Inspiration from the Experts:</h3>

<p>To help you get started, here are some inspiring personal websites you can check out:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://stallman.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Richard Stallman's Website:</strong><a/> While I mentioned him to show how his website, Richard Stallman is someone you should definitely know about if you are using computers. Check out his works on open source and the GNU project. Watch his TED talk and the Revolution OS documentary if you want to know more of that stuff.</li>
    
    <li><a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Bjarne Stroustrup's Website:</strong></a>Discover the homepage of the creator of C++.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Inspiration from SOE-ians:</h3>

<p>Now, let's take a look at some of our own talented SOE-ians:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://rohittp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Rohit:</strong><a/> This is a guy who started coding around 6th or 7th grade. If you need motivation, just look at his achievements from last month. GitHub sent him a MacBook Pro because of his internship there. He freelances so much that he bought an S23 Ultra smartphone. I won't continue, as the list is too long.</li>
    <li><a href="https://sinanmohd.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Sinan Mohd:</strong><a/>  If you meet him by chance, run for life!!! jk, he's a true open-source aficionado. Not a single line of proprietary code can be found on his devices. His website, built purely with HTML and CSS, is hosted on his own server at home. Ask him anything about GNU/Linux.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many more talented individuals in our college who can serve as sources of inspiration. These are just a few of the amazing people I personally know (wondering who am I? "I" am the narrator from fight club). </p>
<p>"Why worship legends when you know that you can join 'em?" - Lil Nas X. Start your journey now, and remember that we are always here to help.</p>

<p>So, are you ready to embark on this exciting journey of website building? Don't miss out on this opportunity to showcase your skills and win fantastic prizes. Get creative, get coding, and let your imagination run wild! If you have any questions or need guidance along the way, feel free to reach out to us. Good luck and happy coding!</p>
